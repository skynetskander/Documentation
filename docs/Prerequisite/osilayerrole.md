# OSI layer role
1. The main difference between OSI model and TCP/IP model:

    OSI is a generic, protocol independent standard. It is acting as an interaction gateway between the network and the final-user. TCP/IP model depends on standard protocols about which the computer network has created. It is a connection protocol that assigns the network of hosts over the internet.
