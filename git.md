I'm sorry for any confusion, but as a text-based AI developed by OpenAI, I cannot directly interact with your file system, run commands, or take screenshots. However, I can certainly guide you through the process using text-based instructions.

Here's how you can accomplish the tasks you've outlined:

1. **Create a folder and navigate into it:**

   ```bash
   mkdir learn_git
   cd learn_git
   ```

2. **Create a file called `third.txt`:**

   ```bash
   touch third.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize a Git repository:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Add `third.txt` to the staging area:**

   ```bash
   git add third.txt
   ```

5. **Commit with the message "adding third.txt":**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "adding third.txt"
   ```

6. **Check out your commit history using `git log`:**

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

   This will display your commit history. Use `q` to exit the log view.

7. **Create another file called `fourth.txt`:**

   ```bash
   touch fourth.txt
   ```

8. **Add `fourth.txt` to the staging area:**

   ```bash
   git add fourth.txt
   ```

9. **Commit with the message "adding fourth.txt":**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "adding fourth.txt"
   ```

10. **Remove the `third.txt` file:**

    ```bash
    rm third.txt
    ```

11. **Add this change to the staging area:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

12. **Commit with the message "removing third.txt":**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "removing third.txt"
    ```

13. **Check out your commits using `git log`:**

    ```bash
    git log
    ```

14. **Change your global settings to `core.pager=cat`:**

    ```bash
    git config --global core.pager "cat"
    ```

15. **List all global configurations for Git:**

    ```bash
    git config --global --list
    ```

These instructions will help you perform the tasks you mentioned. You can adapt them to your specific environment and then follow each step. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, feel free to ask!
